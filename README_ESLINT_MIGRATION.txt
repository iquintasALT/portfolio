# ESLint v9+ Migration Notes

- Your project is now configured for ESLint v9+ with ESM config (`eslint.config.js`).
- You can safely delete the following obsolete files:
  - `.eslintrc.json`
  - `eslint.config.cjs`

- All configuration is now in `eslint.config.js` (ESM, root folder).
- No further changes are needed for your Next.js + React + TypeScript setup.
