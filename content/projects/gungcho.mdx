## About the Project

Gungcho is a fast-paced platformer developed by Null Exc. Studios as a university group project for the 2019-2020 academic year. The game was designed to run on a 64x64 RGB LED matrix, presenting unique challenges in both design and implementation due to the low resolution and hardware constraints. The project was built using Unity and C#, with a focus on delivering responsive controls and engaging platforming gameplay.

## Game Design & Mechanics

The core gameplay revolves around classic platforming: running, jumping, and dodging obstacles. The LED matrix display required careful design of character sprites and level layouts to ensure clarity and playability at such a low resolution. The game features multiple levels, each with increasing difficulty and new mechanics to master. Special attention was given to speed and precision, making Gungcho ideal for speedrunning and competitive play.

## Technologies & Development

- **Unity Engine (C#):** Used for rapid prototyping, physics, animation, and game logic.
- **ShaderLab & HLSL:** Custom shaders for lighting and visual feedback.
- **Team collaboration:** Practiced agile workflows, version control with Git, and asset management.
- **Audio:** Background music by Sergey Cheremisinov ("The Healing").

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

Adapting a platformer to an LED matrix display was a unique challenge, requiring creative solutions for visibility and feedback. Optimizing performance and ensuring responsive controls on limited hardware deepened the team's understanding of Unity's rendering pipeline and input systems. Working in a team environment also improved communication and project management skills.
