## About the Project

Nonogramas is a mobile puzzle game for Android, inspired by classic nonogram (picross) logic puzzles. The app is built in Java using Android Studio and a custom game engine abstraction, providing a smooth and interactive experience for mobile users.

## Game Design & Features

- **Classic Nonogram Gameplay:** Solve grid-based logic puzzles by filling in cells according to numeric clues.
- **Multiple Game States:** Includes main menu, game, shop, story, and selection screens, each managed by a robust state system.
- **Custom Board Logic:** The `Board` and `Cell` classes handle puzzle logic, solution checking, and dynamic rendering.
- **Progression & Rewards:** Tracks solved levels, unlocks new puzzles and palettes, and manages coins and lives.
- **Persistence:** Uses serialization to save and load player progress and settings.
- **Ads Integration:** Includes AdMob banner support for monetization.
- **Sensor Integration:** (If present) Uses device sensors for enhanced gameplay or UI effects.

## Technologies & Architecture

- **Java & Android Studio:** Core development platform.
- **Custom Engine Layer:** Abstracts graphics, input, and state management for modularity and reusability.
- **MVC-like Structure:** Separates game logic (`gamelogic`), UI (`res/layout`), and state management (`states`).
- **XML Layouts:** Defines responsive UI for main screens and menus.
- **Resource Management:** Organized assets, layouts, and values for scalable development.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

- **State Management:** Implemented a flexible state system for seamless transitions between menus and gameplay.
- **Persistence:** Learned to serialize/deserialize game data for robust save/load functionality.
- **UI/UX:** Designed intuitive layouts and touch controls for mobile play.
- **Android Lifecycle:** Managed activity lifecycle, configuration changes, and resource cleanup.
- **Testing & Debugging:** Gained experience with Android debugging tools and emulator/device testing.

## Conclusion

Nonogramas was a comprehensive introduction to mobile game development, Android best practices, and custom engine design. The project strengthened my skills in Java, UI/UX, state management, and mobile app architecture.
