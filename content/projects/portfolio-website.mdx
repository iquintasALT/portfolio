## Introduction

The goal was to showcase the skills I adquired doing this react course [link] and the ones I've developed on my own.

this site is a single page application that combines static and dynamic routes in order to allow fast time loads, good SEO, and avoid unnecessary redeploys on changing content.
There's pending work to do.

I wanted to create a mobile focused UI that only displayed each section as a fullpage layour with scroll snap sections.

## Libraries and Tools

- React as the main core of the app.
- Redux for state management
- **Next.js:** Server-side rendering, static site generation, and dynamic routing for optimal performance and SEO.
- Vercel blob: Dynamic storage to fetch without rebuilding the app.
- Motion: Custom animations
- **TypeScript:** Type-safe codebase for reliability and scalability.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first styling for rapid, consistent UI development.
- **Jest:** (Planned) Unit tests for robust code quality.
- **Playwright/Cypress**: (Planned) End to end tests.

## Features

Swipe mobile first intuitive UI

- **API Routes:** Dynamic data fetching with Vercel Blob and server-side logic using Next.js API endpoints.
- **Content Management:** Projects, skills, and texts are managed via structured JSON and MDX files for easy localization and updates.
  Motion animated visually appealing components
- **Dark/Light Mode:** Modern theme toggle with CSS variables and system preference support.
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and ARIA best practices.

## Challenges

For my fullpage layout, I created my component `SectionTransitionWrapper`:

```tsx {1-3}"
// Example: SectionTransitionWrapper usage
<SectionTransitionWrapper>
  <Section id="about">About</Section>
  <Section id="projects">Projects</Section>
  <Section id="contact">Contact</Section>
</SectionTransitionWrapper>
```

This component ensures each section fills the viewport and enables smooth scroll snap navigation between them, providing a mobile-first, app-like experience.

## Future Work

- Internationalization (i18n)
- Light mode
- Unit and end-to-end (e2e) tests
- Further performance optimizations, specially with motion components
- Rate limits on blob files
- Sanitize file paths

```tsx
if (filePathArr.some(part => part.includes('..'))) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Invalid file path." }, { status: 400 });
}
```
