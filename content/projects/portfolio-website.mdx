## About the Project

This portfolio website is a showcase of my work, skills, and technical approach as a developer. Built with Next.js and React, it leverages the latest best practices in frontend and backend development, with a focus on performance, accessibility, and maintainability.

## Features & Architecture

- **Next.js & React:** Server-side rendering, static site generation, and dynamic routing for optimal performance and SEO.
- **TypeScript:** Type-safe codebase for reliability and scalability.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first styling for rapid, consistent UI development.
- **Content Management:** Projects, skills, and texts are managed via structured JSON and MDX files for easy localization and updates.
- **API Routes:** Dynamic data fetching and server-side logic using Next.js API endpoints.
- **Dark/Light Mode:** Modern theme toggle with CSS variables and system preference support.
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and ARIA best practices.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first layouts and adaptive components.
- **Testing:** (Planned) Unit and end-to-end tests for robust code quality.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

- **Localization:** Designed the content structure for future i18n support.
- **Performance:** Optimized images, code splitting, and lazy loading for fast load times.
- **UI/UX:** Iterated on navigation, section transitions, and interactive elements for a smooth user experience.
- **Content Management:** Centralized all static and dynamic content for maintainability and scalability.
- **Modern CSS:** Adopted variable-based color schemes and robust dark/light mode support.

## Future Features

- Internationalization (i18n)
- Light mode improvements
- Unit and end-to-end (e2e) tests
- Further performance optimizations
