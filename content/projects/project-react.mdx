## About the Project

Booking React Mook is a modern, client-side booking platform built with React and TypeScript. The project demonstrates advanced state management, data fetching, and UI/UX best practices, using a robust stack of libraries and tools for a scalable, maintainable codebase.

## Features & Architecture

- **React + Vite:** Fast development and build tooling with modern React features.
- **Redux Toolkit:** Centralized state management for user, booking, and UI state.
- **React Query:** Efficient async data fetching, caching, and background updates.
- **Radix UI:** Accessible, unstyled UI primitives for building custom components.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS for rapid, consistent styling.
- **React Router:** Client-side routing for a multi-page SPA experience.
- **Zod:** Schema validation for forms and API responses.
- **Axios:** HTTP client for API communication and mocking.
- **Component Organization:** Modular structure with `components/`, `api/`, `hooks/`, `state/`, and `pages/` directories.
- **Testing & Linting:** ESLint, Prettier, and strong type checking for code quality.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

- **State Management:** Leveraged Redux Toolkit and React Query for scalable, maintainable state and data logic.
- **UI/UX:** Built accessible, responsive interfaces with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
- **API Mocking:** Used Axios Mock Adapter for local development and testing.
- **Performance:** Optimized with Vite, code splitting, and lazy loading.
- **Type Safety:** Adopted TypeScript and Zod for robust, error-resistant code.
